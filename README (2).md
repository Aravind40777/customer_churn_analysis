Customer Churn Analysis (EDA Project) :



This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of a telecom customer churn dataset to understand customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and extract key business insights.



Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company's services. Understanding churn helps businesses improve retention strategies.





Project Objectives :



\* Analyze customer demographics and service usage

\* Identify key factors influencing churn

\* Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

\* Visualize churn patterns using graphs

\* Provide business insights and recommendations



Dataset Information :



\* Dataset Name: Telco Customer Churn Dataset

\* Source: kaggle

\* Industry: Telecommunications

\* Total Records: ~7,000 customers

\* Features:21 columns



Target Variable :



\* Churn (Yes / No)



Tools \& Technologies Used :



\* Python

\* Pandas

\* NumPy

\* Matplotlib

Data Cleaning Steps :



\* Handled missing values in Total Charges

\* Converted data types

\* Removed blank spaces

\* Checked for null values

\* Prepared dataset for analysis



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :



Univariate Analysis :



\* Customer churn distribution

\* Contract type distribution

\* Internet service usage



Bivariate Analysis :



\* Gender vs Churn

\* Contract vs Churn

\* Monthly Charges vs Churn

\* Tenure vs Churn



Multivariate Analysis :



\* Pivot tables

\* Heatmaps

\* Line plots showing relationships between multiple variables



Key Insights :



\* Month-to-month contract customers show the highest churn.

\* Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

\* New customers (low tenure) churn more frequently.

\* Fiber optic users pay the highest monthly charges.

\* Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn risk.





Business Recommendations :



\* Encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts

\* Offer discounts to high-charge customers

\* Improve early customer engagement programs

\* Provide loyalty benefits to new users
